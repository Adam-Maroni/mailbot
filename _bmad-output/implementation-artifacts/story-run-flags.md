# Story-Run Flags — `/autonomous-story-run` per-invocation log

This file collects flags raised by `autonomous-story-run` runs. One block per invocation.

## Story 1-10 — 2026-06-01

**Headline:** 4 sync-correctness patches shipped (ImmutableId Prefer header, changeKey-first extraction with @odata.etag fallback, @removed.reason capture, 410+syncStateNotFound full-resync recovery with debounced urgent notification). 7 code-review issues found and applied including 1 HIGH-severity production correctness bug.

**Dev model:** claude-opus-4-7 (inline execution, no sub-skill delegation)
**Review model:** claude-sonnet-4-6 (Agent tool subagent)

**Review rounds run:** 1. Issues found: 7. Issues applied: 7. Apply rate: 100% (≥70% threshold ✓).

**Aggregated [deferred:*] items:** none.

**Gate verdicts:**

- 2.3.5 (Pre-Review Self-Audit) — PASS (all 5 sections; §3 surfaced 7 self-caught issues with dispositions; §5 posture audit 11/11 with one §5.9 cited-figure correction applied)
- 2.4 (Code Review) — PASS (7 issues, all applied; biggest find: HIGH-severity nested-vs-flat error.code mismatch that would have silently broken AC-5 against real Graph)
- 2.4.4 (Dev Agent Record completeness) — PASS (model named, completion notes 1+ bullet per AC, File List populated, story-file Status=done)
- 2.4.5 (UI scope) — N/A (no graphical frontend per PORTING.md)
- 2.4.6 (File-List-vs-git) — PASS (all 9 File List entries `git ls-files` clean after staging migration 005)
- 2.4.7 (Middleware-Real-Bootstrap, MailBot reframing) — PASS (DB-real integration tests via real SQLite + `apply_pending_migrations`; httpx.MockTransport mocks the Graph network seam not the Router/queries)
- 2.4.8 (Verbose-row truncation) — PASS (sprint-status row collapsed to one-line headline; full narrative in `## Completion Notes` block in story file)

**Step 2.5 dev-env verification:** N/A — no `<dev-env-skill>` configured for MailBot. (Future evolution: a `/debug-mailbot-stack` skill that boots docker compose, hits `/health`, validates the worker is heartbeating to `worker_health`, would land here.)

**Pre-flight reconciliations performed (informational, not flags):**

- `epic-1: done` → `in-progress` (story 1-10 was backlog inside a done epic; this would have halted at Step 0.2)
- `1-10: backlog` → `ready-for-dev` → `review` → `done` (story file was authored but row not updated)

**Permission-prompt summary:** No permission log configured on this project. Count of mid-run prompts unknown. (One PowerShell command — `ls "C:/Users/Adam/.claude/plugins/cache/skill-creator/..."` — failed with a shell escape error and required manual recovery, but this was an earlier skill-creator-related issue, not a 1-10 dev-flow prompt.)

**Notable patterns surfaced for the next retro / process improvement:**

- The HIGH-severity code-review find (nested error.code) was a textbook case of the Middleware-Real-Bootstrap gate's value: unit tests passing on a synthetic fixture shape silently failed to validate the real Graph error envelope. The dev model's pre-review audit (§5.6 upstream-contract) cited the archived docs but did not cross-check the test fixture shape against the docs' actual error envelope examples. **Process suggestion:** §5.6 should require pasting one real-Graph error-body example (from the archived docs) alongside the test fixture for any error-path test.
- Sprint-status drift (epic-1 done + child story backlog) was caught at Step 0.2; the skill correctly halted and surfaced the right fix to the user. **No skill change needed.** Confirms the integrity gate's design.

## Story 1-10 Manual Verification — 2026-06-01

**Verdict:** PASS WITH FINDINGS

**Findings:**

- Checkpoints 1–7 (live Graph behavior: Prefer header on /me + delta, changeKey semantics, removed_reason capture, 410 + 404+syncStateNotFound recovery, debounce) all require real `OUTLOOK_*` env vars on a dev host. No such configuration available on the current host.
- Checkpoint 8 (no duplicate `graph_id` rows in live DB) vacuously passed — no live SQLite DB exists yet (./mailbot.db not found; only mypy caches present). Integration test `test_handles_duplicate_message_in_single_delta_page` is the meaningful evidence for AC-6 until the real worker runs.

**Disposition:** Story 1-10 stays `done`. The 7 deferred checkpoints fold into a single real-tenant smoke session that should also exercise Story 1-5's and Story 1-9's deferred smokes (both have identical "no `OUTLOOK_*` env vars on dev host" carry-overs). When that session runs, all three stories' Phase 3.5 checkpoints are walked together; any failures spawn follow-up bug-fix stories rather than reopening 1-10.

**Recommended carry-forward:** add a "real-tenant smoke for Stories 1-5/1-9/1-10" item to the epic-2 retrospective intake (or as a discrete story 1-11 if the smoke surfaces enough work). Do NOT block epic-1 closure on it — the pattern is consistent with how 1-9 was closed.
